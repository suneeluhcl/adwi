# System Audit

Generated: 2026-06-26T04:48:28.015997-05:00

## Scope

Inspected workspace metadata, subsystem structure, command surfaces, MCP configuration, autolab state, orchestration files, goal-engine files, comms files, docs, logs, and state files under `~/SuneelWorkSpace`.

No private home-directory file contents were ingested. Home awareness is limited to top-level directory names and system/application metadata.

## Current Architecture

- `agent-system`: present; files observed: 37
- `mcp`: present; files observed: 31
- `orchestrator`: present; files observed: 20
- `goal-engine`: present; files observed: 27
- `autolab`: present; files observed: 163
- `comms`: present; files observed: 35
- `bin`: present; files observed: 77
- `scripts`: present; files observed: 4
- `configs`: missing; files observed: 0
- `docs`: present; files observed: 3

## Strengths

- Shared agent state is file-based and inspectable.
- Autolab already has evaluator, frontier, reports, rollback notes, and safety policy files.
- MCP server has local storage, resource maps, tool policies, and doctor/reindex scripts.
- Goal engine and orchestrator already expose planning, routing, history, and report surfaces.
- Comms commands exist for mail/message workflow primitives.

## Fragile Areas

- Several subsystems are connected by conventions and scripts rather than a central capability registry.
- Logs, backups, quarantine, and snapshots can grow without a user-facing retention summary.
- Daily workflow support needs more routeable playbooks before it feels like an operating system.
- Research decisions need explicit promotion into MEMORY.md, DECISIONS.md, patterns, and insights.
- Mac app automation should remain opt-in because Mail, Messages, downloads, and files are private surfaces.

## Missing Or Incomplete Subsystems

- [P0] architecture: System-wide audit artifacts were missing or not first-class. Impact: Agents could inspect files ad hoc, but there was no durable overview for future sessions.
- [P0] automation: Health checks did not summarize audit/gap/research/tool readiness. Impact: Maintenance could report green while intelligence coverage was incomplete.
- [P1] intelligence: Ideas, comparisons, and decisions had no dedicated pipeline. Impact: Research outcomes could remain in chat instead of becoming durable shared brain context.
- [P1] research: Tool discovery was not summarized into an inspectable inventory. Impact: Agents had to rediscover installed CLIs, apps, and integration candidates.
- [P1] workflow: Email, messaging, downloads, and file organization support existed only as scattered commands. Impact: Daily workflows lacked a unified route from capture to execution to memory.
- [P0] usability: There was no single command for capabilities, gaps, recommendations, or bounded self-upgrade. Impact: Suneel had to know internal paths and command names.
- [P1] architecture: MCP resource coverage did not include audit, research, profile, and tool artifacts. Impact: Connected agents could miss the new intelligence surfaces.
- [P1] automation: Autolab evaluates improvements, but weak-area discovery was not tied to system gaps. Impact: Self-improvement can optimize local prompt/docs while missing architecture-level needs.

## Command Surface

- Workspace commands found: 75
- Non-executable bin files: 0
- Tool inventory entries: 108

## System Introspection

- CPU count: 16
- Memory GB: 64.0
- Home disk free GB: 649.8
- Installed application names captured: 25
- Home top-level directory names captured: 59

## Upgrade Direction

The correct upgrade is not a rebuild. Keep the existing agent-system, MCP, orchestrator, goal-engine, comms, and autolab structure, then add a system intelligence layer that can audit, profile, recommend, and route ideas into research/decision artifacts.
