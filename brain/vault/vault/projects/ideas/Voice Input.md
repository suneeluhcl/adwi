# Voice Input

#idea #roadmap #voice

## Status
🔵 Planned — not started

## Why It Matters
Lets you prompt Adwi without typing. Especially useful when hands are occupied, during debugging sessions, or for quick queries. The M4 Max's CoreML support makes whisper.cpp fast on-device.

## Existing Related Files

| File | Relevance |
|------|-----------|
| `adwi/voice.py` | Already has STT (faster-whisper) + TTS (piper-tts) |
| `adwi/adwi_cli.py` | `/voice`, `/voice-in`, `/voice-brief`, `/listen` already wired |
| `adwi/bin/adwi` | Entry point to integrate voice trigger |

*Note: `voice.py` already exists with faster-whisper. The gap is making it the default input path and testing it end-to-end.*

## Implementation Sketch

1. Confirm faster-whisper `base.en` model is working on M4 Max via CoreML
2. Add a `--voice` flag to `bin/adwi` that launches with `/listen` active by default
3. Test the STT → handle() dispatch loop for latency
4. Add wake-word detection (optional, later)
5. Ensure `/voice-out` TTS responds to all outputs in voice mode

## Risks

- Latency: STT + LLM + TTS may feel slow; measure end-to-end
- False activations in `/listen` silence-detection (sox 3% threshold)
- Model size: faster-whisper base.en is ~150 MB — already available

## Next Action

Run `/listen` and test a complete voice prompt → response → TTS cycle. Measure latency.
