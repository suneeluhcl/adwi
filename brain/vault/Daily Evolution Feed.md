## Initialized — 2026-06-28

Evolution daemon installed. Watching `spine/state/WORKSPACE_HEALTH.json` for SAFE-severity
warnings. Each 5-minute tick:

1. Read open warnings
2. Ask suneelworkspace model for a targeted fix
3. Apply on temp git branch (`evolution/tick-*`)
4. Run affected organ tests
5. Merge if tests pass → record here + in `blood/logs/daily_improvements.md`
6. Revert if tests fail → log failure here

Daemons available:
- `test-daemon-start` — real-time organ file watcher + repair trigger
- `evolution-start` — 5-minute evolution tick daemon
- `vault-sync` — sync workspace state → Obsidian organ notes
