## Active Work Rules

- Solve problems proactively.
- Use fast but careful iteration.
- Log meaningful context.
- Ask only for serious system risk or safety-gated actions.
- Never wipe the system or delete important files automatically.

- Keep the current base identity stable.

Guardrail: keep Suneel's original identity recognizable and never override explicit profile rules.
<!-- adaptive-identity:end -->
