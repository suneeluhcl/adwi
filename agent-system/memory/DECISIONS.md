# Decisions

## 2026-06-24 - Use A File-Based Shared Agent Workspace

Decision: Use `~/SuneelWorkSpace` as the canonical local workspace for shared agent instructions, memory, tasks, logs, state, and handoffs.

Reason: File-based markdown and JSON are transparent, durable, easy to inspect, and usable by both Claude Code and Codex CLI without an external service.

## 2026-06-24 - Use One Canonical Instruction File

Decision: Use `~/SuneelWorkSpace/agent-system/shared/AGENT_SYSTEM.md` as the canonical shared instruction file.

Reason: A single source of truth avoids drift between `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and global tool configuration.

## 2026-06-24 - Use Symlink Entrypoints When Possible

Decision: Point `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to the canonical instruction file with symlinks when possible.

Reason: Symlinks keep instructions synchronized without copying content across files.

## 2026-06-24 - Add Safe Local Self-Maintenance

Decision: Add doctor, repair, maintain, index, backup, report, and context scripts under `~/SuneelWorkSpace/bin`, with implementation kept in readable local shell/Python.

Reason: Suneel wants a living workspace that stays healthy without remembering manual startup steps. Plain scripts and JSON reports provide this without an opaque database or external service.

## 2026-06-24 - Use One Lightweight launchd Job

Decision: Use one user-level launchd job for periodic lightweight maintenance when available.

Reason: A single local job is simpler and safer than multiple noisy watchers. Tool wrappers still run preflight maintenance before launching Claude or Codex.

## 2026-06-24 - Make Auto-Closeout The Default

Decision: Add `agent-autoclose` and run it from Claude/Codex wrappers, zsh shell exit hooks, inactivity maintenance, and startup recovery.

Reason: Suneel should not need to remember `agent-finish` for normal operation. Intentional agent-written closeout is still preferred when possible, but automatic persistence now provides the default safety net.

## 2026-06-24 - Add Workspace Autolab

Decision: Add `~/SuneelWorkSpace/autolab/` as a safe autoresearch-style subsystem for iterative workspace self-improvement.

Reason: Suneel wants the workspace to improve its own prompts, rules, automation, wrappers, validation, reporting, repair logic, and operational behavior over time. Autolab uses file-based evaluation, snapshots, keep/revert decisions, and append-only experiment logs rather than model-weight training or opaque services.

## 2026-06-24 - Add Autolab v2 Meta-Learning

Decision: Extend Autolab with local meta-learning files, pattern analysis, failure intelligence, strategy versioning, and heuristic experiment selection.

Reason: The workspace should learn from its own experiment history. Patterns and failures remain plain JSON/Markdown files so Claude and Codex can inspect and share the same learning without external services.
