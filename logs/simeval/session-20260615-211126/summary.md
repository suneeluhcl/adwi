### Latency Observations

- Average LLM latency: **1774 ms**
- P95 LLM latency: **2092 ms**

**Top 5 slowest prompts:**
  - 3496ms: `disk space analysis`
  - 2706ms: `check my disk`
  - 2648ms: `i want to know more about how to set up a proper n8n webhook to trigger adwi com`
  - 2593ms: `my obsidian vault has gotten really messy with hundreds of notes and i'm not sur`
  - 2452ms: `explain the difference between Qdrant and Chroma`

### Routing Consistency Issues

15 paraphrase families showed inconsistent routing:

- **cleanup_basic**: saw ['organize', 'large_files', 'disk_usage', 'memory_recall', 'cleanup'] (25% majority)
- **fix_error_basic**: saw ['fix_error', 'old_files', 'disk_usage', 'image', 'generate_image', 'chat'] (25% majority)
- **large_files_basic**: saw ['disk_usage', 'large_files'] (50% majority)
- **git_status_basic**: saw ['disk_usage', 'git_status', 'chat', 'memory_recall'] (50% majority)
- **model_status**: saw ['disk_usage', 'status', 'generate_image'] (50% majority)

## 3. Safe Auto-Enhancements Applied

**None.** This was an evidence-collection session. No production files were modified.

---

## 4. Needs Human Review

- **[HIGH]** Routing miss: expected 'fix_error': Add regex or NLU fixture anchoring 'fix_error'
- **[HIGH]** Routing miss: expected 'git_status': Add regex or NLU fixture anchoring 'git_status'
- **[HIGH]** Routing miss: expected 'large_files': Add regex or NLU fixture anchoring 'large_files'
- **[HIGH]** Routing miss: expected 'nightly_status': Add regex or NLU fixture anchoring 'nightly_status'
- **[HIGH]** Routing miss: expected 'obsidian_search': Add regex or NLU fixture anchoring 'obsidian_search'

## 6. New Eval Assets Created

- **15 new NLU fixture candidates** generated from routing failures
  - Written to: `/Users/MAC/SuneelWorkSpace/logs/simeval/session-20260615-211126/new_eval_assets.jsonl`
  - Review and add to `adwi/memory.py` NLU_SEED_FIXTURES if correct
